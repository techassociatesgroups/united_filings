          <h3>What is Halal Certificate?</h3>
          <p>
            Halal Certification is predominantly obtained for food and food-related products, and it 
            is essential in Islamic countries. The term "Halal" is derived from the Quran, which means 
            "permitted" or "lawful." Therefore, according to Islamic law, the Shariah, the Certification 
            is used for Food and other consumables permissible for consumption. Halal India Certification 
            emphasizes cleanliness in all aspects of a person's life, and Halal foods ensure that the 
            Food consumed by individuals is clean, hygienic, and does not harm their health or well-being.

          <h3>What is Halal Certification in India?</h3>
          <p>
            In India, a Halal Certificate is a document issued by a Halal certification body or authority 
            confirming that a product or service complies with Islamic dietary laws and guidelines and is 
            permissible or "Halal" for consumption by Muslims.

          <p>
            Halal Certification in India is significant for food and beverage products, pharmaceuticals, 
            and personal care products. Still, it can also apply to other non-food products or services. 
            Businesses seeking Halal Certification in India must comply with the relevant standards and 
            guidelines set forth by the certification body or authority and undergo a rigorous inspection
